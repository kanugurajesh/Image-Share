This project can be easily deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Follow the steps below to deploy your application:

1. Sign up or log in to Vercel: If you don't have an account on Vercel, you can sign up for free at https://vercel.com. If you already have an account, log in to your dashboard.

2. Import this GitHub repository: In the Vercel dashboard, click on "Import Project" and select the option to import from GitHub. Choose the repository that contains your project.

3. Configure settings (if needed): Vercel will automatically detect most of the settings for your project. However, if you need to customize the build settings or environment variables, you can do that during the import process.

4. Deploy your application: After importing the repository, Vercel will start the deployment process automatically. It will build your project and deploy it to a unique URL.

5. Monitor your deployment: Once the deployment is complete, you can monitor the progress and status of your application on the Vercel dashboard. Any subsequent pushes to the linked branch will trigger automatic redeployments.
